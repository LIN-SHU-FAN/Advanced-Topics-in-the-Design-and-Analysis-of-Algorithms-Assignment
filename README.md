# Final Project

### Subject
Frequent pattern mining is a powerful tool to mine the shopping behavior of customers. In this homework, students are asked to mine the frequent patterns from the given data. 

The goal is 
1. Implement the Apriori algorithm
2. Compare the scalability of the Apriori algorithm and understand the reasons
3. Improve the performance of the original Apriori algorithm by designing some mechanisms

### Evaluation Criteria
1. (10%) Implement the Apriori algorithm using packages with min_support=0.05 on **[Data.txt](https://github.com/LIN-SHU-FAN/Algorithm-project/blob/main/data%20set/normal%20data%20set/data.txt)** and collect the final frequent itemsets S
2. (5%) Implement the Apriori algorithm without packages with min_support=0.05 on **[Data.txt](https://github.com/LIN-SHU-FAN/Algorithm-project/blob/main/data%20set/normal%20data%20set/data.txt)** and collect the final frequent itemsets S
3. (5%) Implement the Apriori algorithm without packages with min_sup=0.0003, min_sup=0.0006, and min_sup=0.0009, respectively on **[Music.txt](https://github.com/LIN-SHU-FAN/Algorithm-project/tree/main/data%20set/massive%20data%20set)** and collect the final frequent itemsets S
4. (Bonus) Implement the Apriori algorithm in R with min_support=0.05 on **[Data.txt](https://github.com/LIN-SHU-FAN/Algorithm-project/blob/main/data%20set/normal%20data%20set/data.txt)** and collect the final frequent itemsets S

5. (Bonus) Design some mechanisms to further improve the performance of the original Apriori algorithm, e.g. TID list, Bitmap, and FP-Growth. You should provide the improved program, and describe the implementation detail and the differences between your improved algorithm and the original Apriori algorithm as clearly as possible
7. **Plagiarism from the internet when not using packages will result in zero for the project**
